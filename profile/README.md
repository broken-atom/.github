# Introduction

At Brokenatom, We are building a no code platform for creating and maintaining full stack applications with scalable system and databases with versioning capabilities so that nothing is ever lost. With our platform, now it just takes an idea about how an application should work and basic data storing models in compliance with the application and all the other things will be taken care of without involving even tiniest bit of code from the user side. Evolving into the world of no code along with the world, we intend to surpass it one step at a time.
